" ""Discourse Mode Categorization of {B}engali Social Media Health Text"","," ""the scarcity of annotated data is a major impediment to natural language processing (nlp) research in bengali, a language that is considered low-resource. in particular, the health and medical domains suffer from a severe paucity of annotated data. thus, this study aims to introduce banglasocialhealth, an annotated social media health corpus that provides sentence-level annotations of four distinct types of expression modes, namely narrative (nar), informative (inf), suggestive (sug), and inquiring (inq) modes in bengali. we provide details regarding the annotation procedures and report various statistics, such as the median and mean length of words in different sentence modes. additionally, we apply classical machine learning (cml) classifiers and transformer-based language models to classify sentence modes. we find that most of the statistical properties are similar in different types of sentence modes. to determine the sentence mode, the transformer-based m-bert model provides slightly better efficacy than the cml classifiers. our developed corpus and analysis represent a much-needed contribution to bengali nlp research in medical and health domains and have the potential to facilitate a range of downstream tasks, including question-answering, misinformation detection, and information retrieval."",",medical domain,natural language process,annotat

" ""A Semantically Annotated {S}wedish Medical Corpus"","," ""with the information overload in the life sciences there is an increasing need for annotated corpora, particularly with biological and biomedical entities, which is the driving force for data-driven language processing applications and the empirical approach to language study. inspired by the work in the genia corpus, which is one of the very few of such corpora, extensively used in the biomedical field, and in order to fulfil the needs of our research, we have collected a swedish medical corpus, the medlex corpus. medlex is a large structurally and linguistically annotated document collection, consisting of a variety of text documents related to various medical text subfields, and does not focus at a particular medical genre, due to the lack of large swedish resources within a particular medical subdomain. out of this collection we selected 300 documents which were manually examined by two human experts who inspected, corrected and/or accordingly modified the automatically provided annotations according to a set of provided labelling guidelines. the annotations consist of medical terminology provided by the swedish and english mesh{\copyright} (medical subject headings) thesauri as well as named entity labels provided by an enhanced named entity recognition software."",",medical text,language process,annotat
" ""Learning Patterns for Building Resources about Semantic Relations in the Medical Domain"","," ""in this article, we present a method for extracting automatically semantic relations from texts in the medical domain using linguistic patterns. these patterns refer to three levels of information about words: inflected form, lemma and part-of-speech. the method we present consists first in identifying the entities that are part of the relations to extract, that is to say diseases, exams, treatments, drugs or symptoms. thereafter, sentences that contain couples of entities are extracted and the presence of a semantic relation is validated by applying linguistic patterns. these patterns were previously learnt automatically from a manually annotated corpus by relying onan algorithm based on the edit distance. we first report the results of an evaluation of our medical entity tagger for the five types of entities we have mentioned above and then, more globally, the results of an evaluation of our extraction method for four relations between these entities. both evaluations were done for french."",",medical domain,semant,annotat
" ""System Evaluation on a Named Entity Corpus from Clinical Notes"","," ""this paper presents the evaluation of the dictionary look-up component of mayo clinics information extraction system. the component was tested on a corpus of 160 free-text clinical notes which were manually annotated with the named entity disease. this kind of clinical text presents many language challenges such as fragmented sentences and heavy use of abbreviations and acronyms. the dictionary used for this evaluation was a subset of snomed-ct with semantic types corresponding to diseases/disorders without any augmentation. the algorithm achieves an f-score of 0.56 for exact matches and f-scores of 0.76 and 0.62 for right and left-partial matches respectively. machine learning techniques are currently under investigation to improve this task."",",clinical not,semant,annotat
" ""Constructing Evaluation Corpora for Automated Clinical Named Entity Recognition"","," ""we report on the construction of a gold-standard dataset consisting of annotated clinical notes suitable for evaluating our biomedical named entity recognition system. the dataset is the result of consensus between four human annotators and contains 1,556 annotations on 160 clinical notes using 658 unique concept codes from snomed-ct corresponding to human disorders. inter-annotator agreement was calculated on annotations from 100 of the documents for span (90.9{\%}), concept code (81.7{\%}), context (84.8{\%}), and status (86.0{\%}) agreement. complete agreement for span, concept code, context, and status was 74.6{\%}. we found that creating a consensus set based on annotations from two independently-created annotation sets can reduce inter-annotator disagreement by 32.3{\%}. we found little benefit to pre-annotating the corpus with a third-party named entity recognizer."",",clinical not,entity recognit,annotat
" ""Collection, Encoding and Linguistic Processing of a {S}wedish Medical Corpus - The {MEDLEX} Experience"","," ""corpora annotated with structural and linguistic characteristics play a major role in nearly every area of language processing. during recent years a number of corpora and large data sets became known and available to research even in specialized fields such as medicine, but still however, targeted predominantly for the english language. this paper provides a description of the collection, encoding and linguistic processing of an ever growing swedish medical corpus, the medlex corpus. medlex consists of a variety of text-documents related to various medical text genres. the medlex corpus has been structurally annotated using the corpus encoding standard for xml (xces), lemmatized and automatically annotated with part-of-speech and semantic information (extended named entities and the medical subject headings, mesh, terminology). the results from the processing stages (part-of-speech, entities and terminology) have been merged into a single representation format and syntactically analysed using a cascaded finite state parser. finally, the parsers results are converted into a tree structure that follows the tiger-xml coding scheme, resulting a suitable for further exploration and fairly large treebank of swedish medical texts."",",medical text,language process,annotat

" ""Annotation of Coreference Relations Among Linguistic Expressions and Images in Biological Articles"","," ""in this paper, we propose an annotation scheme which can be used not only for annotating coreference relations between linguistic expressions, but also those among linguistic expressions and images, in scientific texts such as biomedical articles. images in biomedical domain often contain important information for analyses and diagnoses, and we consider that linking images to textual descriptions of their semantic contents in terms of coreference relations is useful for multimodal access to the information. we present our annotation scheme and the concept of a ``coreference pool,'' which plays a central role in the scheme. we also introduce a support tool for text annotation named open ontology forge which we have already developed, and additional functions for the software to cover image annotations (imageof) which is now being developed."",",medical domain,semant,annotat
